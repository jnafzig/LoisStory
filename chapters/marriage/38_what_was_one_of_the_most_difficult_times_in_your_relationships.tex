\section{What was one of the most difficult times in your relationships? How did you get through it?}
Let me begin by saying that John and I did not know each other very well before we got married.
I'm not sure that we had even had a serious argument.
While I thought I was in love and I was at some level, I was also in love with my idea of being in love and getting married.
There was a time in the early years of our marriage that my ideas about being in love and being married hit rough water.
I experienced some painful times of loneliness.
Gradually I went through a time of allowing the reality of the marriage I was in to transform what I expected of marriage.
This was not a fast or easy metamorphosis.
Unfortunately I was not always able to articulate what was happening to myself, let alone John.
Thankfully over years more synchronicity grew into our relationship.
We know each other pretty well, our communication skills are better and there is a strong under lying commitment to each other.
