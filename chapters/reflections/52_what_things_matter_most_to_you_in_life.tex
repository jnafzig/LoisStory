\section{What things matter most to you in life?}
Love, truth, and beauty are important to me.
These are like harbor lights that provide guidance through life's channels.
They add direction and meaning in my day to day living.
They provide splashes of color to life and bring comfort in the night.

Family is important and does not go away.

Gratitude for these things keep me focused on what is good in this life that slips through our fingers like sand.
These things tell me - enjoy this moment you have!
