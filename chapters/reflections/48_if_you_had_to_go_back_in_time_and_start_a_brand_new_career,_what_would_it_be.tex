If you had to go back in time and start a brand new career, what would it be?
There are some jobs that have interested me but I didn't feel I had the preparation/training to pursue; anti-bullying work in the schools, caseworker for restorative justice mediation (CCJ), and working with at risk youth are more recent ones that come to mind. Mediation was a strong interest of mine. I wonder how my work life would have been different if I had taken a social work major in college. I regret missing the opportunity to put a masters in social work alongside the masters in peace studies. I'm sure working with people in some way would have also been part of any new or different career.
