\section{What are some memories you hope never to forget?}
Growing up knowing that I have always been surrounded by sisters and brothers who care about me.
Working and playing together we formed the reality of family.

Moments of coming to understand who I am as an individual, similar yet distinct from the people around me.
Finding my voice and gifts and ways to carve out a unique shape that is my life.

The journey of finding my life partner.
Knowing the joy of discovering each other alongside the pain of facing conflict and knowing that we are richer because we are different from each other.

The experience of three unique childbirths.
Watching, nurturing, accompanying and learning to know each child as they continuously marched toward adulthood.

Completing with meaning and satisfaction a job or a conversation.

Sharing of the resource to which I have access.

Learning more about another person after spending the time and listening.

Knowing that I have been fully alive and contributed to the world around me.
