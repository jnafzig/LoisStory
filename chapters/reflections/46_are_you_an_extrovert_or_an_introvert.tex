\section{Are you an extrovert or an introvert?}
I think that I'm a bit of both.
In the culture in which I grew up women were encouraged to be reserved and let men lead.
What I often found was that I was OK being a background person unless a need or a vacuum appeared.
Then I was often willing and ready to step into leadership.
I enjoy being with other people, listening to their stories and wisdom.
I can also happily spend a day by myself with limited interaction with other people.
Both my job with VIP (Violence Intervention Project) as a mediator and with MCC Great Lakes Peace and Justice as educator/advocate meant that I was communication with people and leading in a variety of ways.
I was energized by this work but I also needed the balance of time away from the office.
Several inventories that I took put me in the middle between introvert and extrovert.
In retrospect I've observed that different seasons of life called for me to more of one than the other and usually I've felt comfortable moving between the two.
