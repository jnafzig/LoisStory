"How did you decide when to have children?"
We had been given the advice that it was good to be married at least a year before getting pregnant. We took that advice and after a year John had a job that paid decently and I had a job at Locust Grove School where the pressure was less since I worked one on one with students. I did not have all the prep planning work of the classroom teaching. 
I got pregnant sometime after our first anniversary. I ended my job at Locust Grove after Christmas and Tim was born in May 1981. 
Dad was one of three children in his family. He liked that family size. Interestingly John's family is a sandwich family and so is ours. I like having three children.
