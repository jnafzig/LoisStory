What was it like for you when your first child left the nest?
I realized that a season of my life was coming to an end.
No longer was I primary care giver for this child with whom I had spent years of my life.
This child was now charting their own course though life.
Arriving at this place had been a gradual process over the years.
There was a push and pull aspect to parenting.
As a parents we wanted our children to make decisions but we wanted them to be good decisions that we approved of.
There were times when we left a child consider if the choice they made was one they would be able to live with.
We wanted to offer the perspective that some choices impacted a lifetime of living.
At some point we needed to let them make their own choices.

The transition out of the nest was time for a shift in the relationship.
We could better understand the relationship adult to adult.
I realize that because I am of another generation our points of view will be different.
Questions that continue to be relevant are about what we value and how that continues to impact how we relate as a family.
