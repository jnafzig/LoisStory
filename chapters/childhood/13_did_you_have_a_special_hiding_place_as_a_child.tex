\section{Did you have a special hiding place as a child?}
I had a place that I frequently hid when we played hide and seek.
It was a closet under the stairs.
The door did not latch and there were bags of rags in the back part of the space.
The front area had hooks for clothing.
When sitting in the back of the closet the darkness closed in around me and the noises of a busy household fell away.
I could breathe the dark stillness as I waited noiselessly hoping that the nearby footsteps would pass the door and leave me undisturbed in my lair.
