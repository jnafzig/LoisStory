\section{Were you involved in any organizations in high school?}
I do not have memories of being involved in high school organizations.
I participated in the choirs, junior and senior years.
I took the college prep track of classes which included Latin and Spanish.
The science required General Science, biology, either chemistry (took this one) or physics.
I chose to avoid physics.
Too bad I didn't take physics and get John to tutor me.
My senior year I took Advance biology and enjoyed it greatly.
One has to remember that I was continuing to help with farm chores morning and evening during most of the high school years.
The year I graduated from high school Pop had a milking parlor installed and I was freed from helping with the milking.

Sometime during my high school year I was invited to join a reading guild.
Several of my girlfriends from high school participated with this group as well.
While I do not remember names of the books we read I have good memories of a weekend spent with these folks at a place on the Chesapeake Bay.
Spending time at the beach was a new experience for me.
