What was your childhood bedroom like?
There were several bedrooms in my childhood. One thing that they had in common was the reality that I never had one to myself. When I was newborn I likely slept in the large metal crib in my parent's bedroom. From there I moved to the "little one's" room. I remember sharing a double bed with Mary with Rachel sleeping in a large metal crib in the corner. As another child came along we each moved up a step to the next sleeping spot. In this room I remember waking up and bumping my head because somehow I ended up under the bed rather than in it.
The next bedroom along the sleeping path was the "girl's room". This room had two double beds in it. Mary and I shared one and Martha and Rhoda the other. At some point Rhoda moved on either to her own room or off to college. Martha soon moved on as well. Than it was a room for Mary, Rachel, Esther and me. This is the room where a few kittens learned that if they climbed the wisteria vine to the window they might be let in. That did not have parental approval. 
When we moved off the farm and to the brick house on the time of the hill. The girls had two rooms across the hall from each other. There was a bathroom conveniently in between. Mary soon left for nurse's training and I had the room to myself. It was from here that I took off to my college classes and after graduation to Honduras for three years.
