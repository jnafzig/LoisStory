What's something you really disagreed with your parents about?

There is more than one thing about which I disagreed with my parents.
One that I realize contributed to deep differences was the perspective that there is an evolution to life.
Much in our lives is continually changing.
At one level my parents may have known this but found it difficult to acknowledge for example that new information and learning can change what a person believes.
Having said that, my parents demonstrated that some values do not change.
One significant constant is when families love and care for each other they are healthier.
