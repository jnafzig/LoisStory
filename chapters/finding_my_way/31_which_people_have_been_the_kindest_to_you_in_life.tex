"Which people have been the kindest to you in life?"
Here are a few kind people that I've met.

This is a group of women from the church I attended as I grew up who cared about me.
Anna Shenk, Betty Warfel and Emma Miller.
Emma was the first Sunday school teacher I had.
I liked watching her tell stories with a flannel graph.
Betty is the woman I worked for as a teenager.
I helped sell fudge, cookies and corn at her Central Market stand in Lancaster, working in the early hours of the morning before I was picked up and driven on to high school.
Betty made sure that I had an egg sandwich for breakfast before I headed out for a day at school.
Anna Shenk was interested in what was happening in other people's lives and always welcomed time to chat.

 During my years at Millersville State College I learned to know a young man from Philadelphia.
His name was Steve Mobley.
He was open about his commitment to follow Jesus and he often initiated conversations with people about the meaning of that commitment.
One day I was studying in a room in the college library when he stopped by to chat.
I was feeling over whelmed by my studies and work and perhaps life in general.
After I was honest about how I was feeling he comforted me.
It was a kind caring that I'd not experienced coming from a man.
I wonder where his journey has taken him.
