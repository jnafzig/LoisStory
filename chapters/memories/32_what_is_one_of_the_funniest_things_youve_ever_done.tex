"What is one of the funniest things you've ever done?"
It took me a while to remember this but here it is.
It was another boring Saturday morning on the farm and I was feeling unnoticed and taken for granted. The chores had been assigned and I do not remember what I was to do that morning. Perhaps it was the dusting, perhaps watering the many house plants my mother kept on the nice wide window sill of the farm house. I doubt I was assigned the baking. So here is what I did. I made myself more invisibly visible. I put the white chenille bedspread over my head. It draped to the floor completely covering me from head to toe. I stood as a white pillar. Perhaps like a pillar of salt. I did not speak as I slowing walked around the house and out to the porch. I did not respond when spoken to. As you may imagine this was irritating to some around me. I remember standing silent and alone in the white world of the chenille bed spread while to those around me I was no longer invisible.
From Abby - This story made me chuckle. What a funny and fascinating thing to have done. It reminds me of some of the goofy things Tim, Jonathan and I did as children.
