\section{What is one of the strangest things you've ever eaten?}
One of the most unique and strange buffet I've eaten at was in Stone Town, Zanzibar.
We were traveling with Rachel, Dennis, Ted and Justine.
We had spent the day exploring the old city's narrow streets and visiting the shops.

Now we were on the beach in a festival type setting and ready to enjoy food.

There was a long table with interesting and different looking food.
I wasn't sure what some of it was and became unsure of eating it when I learned that two of the dishes were octopus and squid.
After a small sample I had no problem leaving the piled up trays of octopus and squid for others to enjoy.
